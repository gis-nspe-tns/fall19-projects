              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, is worldwide known by its Bus Rapid Transportation system (BRT) called Transmilenio (which was inspired in the Curitiba’s experience). The capital is also known for advocating in favor of cycling as a critical mode of transportation. Also, this year, the city’s government contracted the construction and implementation of a new mode of transportation: The Metro. Although different transportation modes are in place, the idea of mobilizing people around the city is still a significant subject of discussion for a city such as Bogotá. As Bocarejo and Oviedo (2012; p. 145) argued: “for the worst-off strata of the population, public transportation is the only modal choice available for medium and long-distances.” In this regard, this project mapped the transportation service areas within the city relative to the characteristics of the areas and the population that remains underserved. For fulfilling these objectives, this project used GIS software and available data (i.e., GTFS data, Population raster data, and socioeconomic strata) from different sources to create a service area within the 19 districts of Bogota (i.e., Sumapaz was excluded from the analysis because it is an entirely rural district). The analysis focused on the urban perimeter. The results showed that 68% of the population that lives within these 19 districts is well served by Public Transportation, while 32% of the population remains underserved. Also, the analysis showed that 28% of the total population that lives in the underserved areas are from Stratum 1,2, and 3, which are the worst-off strata of the population (low-income areas).</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The Amazon forest, named the most biologically diverse place on earth, is under threat because of devastating rainforest fires and rapid deforestation. This final project focuses on understanding the vegetation changes of this vital region in order to find out how protected areas were affected. The aim is to help assess the damages produced by the fires and other forms of deforestation, providing additional tools for environmentalists doing conservation plans; and as a way to raise concerns about this important issue. This project focuses on understanding the forest loss in protected areas and indigenous land in the country of Brazil linked to fire regime. The analysis takes into consideration VIIRS data and Landsat imagery for NDVI values in the project area. The results clearly show a deterioration - both by deforestation and fire regime - in some of the protected lands within the Amazon.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Until 1994, South Africa was ruled by a white supremacist government that enforced a system of racial hierarchy known as apartheid. There was half a century of race-based rules that influence the development of the South African Society. The post-apartheid regime represents the most ambitious and most challenging attempt to create a race-integrated society. This geo spatial study seeks to illustrate the legacy of apartheid in South Africa not only in terms of segregation, but also taking into account the creation of racial enclaves in different wards. With close attention to the city of Cape Town, the visuals denote that regardless of inclusionary policies in 1996, Cape Town is still divided into racial areas which have led to high prices in some areas, while there is the emergence and growing of informal settlements in other parts of the city.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The World is witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record. As the world’s complexity increases at fast rates, armed conflict, famine, diseases, inequality and environmental disasters are becoming the rule more than eventual casualties. Given this, millions of people have been forcibly driven from their communities. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR, 2019), has incorporated the refugee research agenda into its core objectives, therefore collecting data and creating databases to map worldwide migration trends and better understand the refugee issue. This data allows us to analyze the migration trends worldwide and determine which are the areas that are expelling the most people and where are they going to, for this purpose link maps where used. This project focuses on analyzing how the refugee population has increased in the past decades and then focusing on the year 2016 in two areas of interest; Syria and Afghanistan (UNHCR, 2016). These two countries are the top source countries of refugees, due two armed conflicts. The project also provides insights into the 2016 refugee crisis. Locational data - to/from refugee displacement and rates of displacement can help solve persistent shelter allocation issues.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">While demographic mega trends suggest the Earth's population is increasingly concentrated within littoral metropolises, coastlines around the globe are being progressively inundated by sea-level rise. Although estimates of endangered populations vary based upon the degree of global warming projected, it is now clear that urban communities face a significant threat of submersion. The potential impact of the rising oceans upon human populations is difficult to quantify and visually demonstrate using conventional statistical methods. However, GIS spatial analysis using publicly available demographic and land-use data provides one avenue of vulnerability estimation. This project incorporates five models of sea-level rise provided by the NYC Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) to calculate and visualize inundated areas within the city as a whole and in each of the five boroughs separately. These small-scale maps are complemented by a focused, large-scale mapping of land-use submersion in a single census tract within each borough. Both levels of analysis integrate demographic and land-use data to reveal vulnerable aspects of New York City. The results indicate that transportation and utility services, vacant & recreational areas, and industrial land-uses are most threatened. Where residential areas are vulnerable, middle and upper-class white New Yorkers face the highest risk of submersion.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Urbanization leads to the change of land use and land cover in many areas around the world, especially in developing countries. In its bipolar urban development, Ecuador does not follow the pattern of many other countries Latin-American countries which are completely dominated by a single city. Ecuador faces a peculiar process of concentration of population and economic growth in two urban centres: the capital city of Quito and the port city of Guayaquil. This project specifically analyzes the urbanisation process in Quito which is located in the middle of the central-north Highland. It is an important migration pole and has experienced significant demographic growth and land transformations in the last two decades. For the GIS Remote Sensing analysis, Landsat imagery was utilized to map Quito at large scale and compare the increase in its urban areas from 2001 to 2017. Also identified are parish increase during this time period and suggest population growth as a contributing factor for the change in urbanization. Finally, the project denotes possible impacts of the city's urban expansion.</p>
