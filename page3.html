          </h5>
          <p class="card-text">Public transportation relates to multiple aspects of city management. Looking at public transportation systems can shed more light on institutional capacities, design characteristics, socio-economic realities, living patterns, and other dimensions. Nazareth is a city with political, cultural, and historical importance. Additionally to its 76,000 residents, hundreds of thousands of regional residents consider it as the urban center of the metropolis. Nevertheless, the city enjoys a strong tourism industry of a yearly three million foreign visitors. Looking at the local transportation system of Nazareth will promote a greater understanding of the city’s different roles and functions, development’s limitations and economic possibilities, and living patterns.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Rapidly rising waters are already driving displacement and migration around the world, including the U.S. New York City Panel on Climate Change includes predictions of 31 inches of sea level rise in 2050 and 75 inches in 2100, which is the worst-case scenario for the end of the century. However, not everyone is equally affected by climate risks: environmental justice advocates have for decades raised the concern that people of color and low-income communities are disproportionately affected by environmental threats. This GIS analysis provides a sea level rise vulnerability ranking based on incidence (census tracts inundated by sea level rise in 2050 and 2100) and exposure (whether an area is environmental justice eligible or not). The findings show no clear correlation between high risk of inundation and EJ communities, which is, in part, due to the rampant development and gentrification of NYC coastline areas.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Airbnb, a poster child of the “sharing economy”, has been in New York City for over a decade. Today, the company has grown with 3 million listed units on their platform, and over 50,000 in New York City alone. The spatial distribution of listings in New York City, as well as the way in which listings have spread across neighborhoods over time, reveals much about the city’s
            income and wealth distribution. The company has faced accusations of exacerbating the gentrification crisis. My report draws on existing research on Airbnb’s presence in New York City, as well as Neil Smith’s economic theory for the process of gentrification, the rent gap theory, to explore what one type of Airbnb listing, the full-time whole-unit apartment/house, looks like in New York City
            neighborhoods in terms of the revenue generated against census data on household income and median rents.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">When looking at space launch capabilities of nations there are a few things to consider. Firstly, there is a high cost of entry which leads to a limited availability of launch capacity. Secondly, distance from the equator also increases cost. Finally, because of the huge cost, companies partner with nations in order to keep costs down. Because of these reasons the availability of launch sites are limited. In order to determine effective launch sites we will look at distance from the equator and different vectors of launch capacity.</p>

              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">As economic inequality in the United States continues to rise, there is a growing interest among elected officials, policy analysts and activists in a federal jobs program. The program fights inequality by attempting to increase both the overall rate and quality of employment throughout the country. In the implementation of this type of program, the following questions emerge; what parts of the country should be prioritized? Which parts of the country have the fewest job opportunities and lowest quality jobs? To identify these districts, on the county level I conducted a GIS analysis using ArcGis. Utilizing employment data from the American Community Survey 2013-2017 5-year estimates, I ranked each district for levels of priority based on a set of variables related to employment and job quality. In this analysis, I identified 56 high priority counties and 151 medium priority districts. These districts were located all across the country and located near or adjacent to similar counties.</p>

              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">The UTT (UNION OF WORKERS OF THE LAND) represents more than 5000 families producing organic horticultural products on a small scale (1.5 - 5 Ha),in Argentina. The organization is centered in the south-metropolitan area of Buenos Aires and advocates for access to land for small farmers.In addition, the UTT foster campaigns for the sustainable use of the land and the inclusive development of periurban areas.In 2014 the UTT spearheaded the initiative to pass Law 27.118 on family agriculture. This Law is comprehensive of the needs, capacities,and expectations of UTT's small farmers. Likewise, the Law binds the Ministry of Agriculture to implement an interdisciplinary development plan of ruraland periurban areas through the support of small scale family horticulture. Thereby, understanding the pattern of extension of horticulture in themetropolitan area of Buenos Aires becomes paramount for the fulfillment of the Ministry's mandate.</p>
