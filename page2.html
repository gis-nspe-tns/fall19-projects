          </h5>
          <p class="card-text">In August 2019, the National Institute of Space Research of Brazil (INPE) reported that there was a significant increase in the fires occurring in the Amazon rainforest, around 80% when compared with the same period of 2018 (Gahanan, 2019). This was also reported by NASA, since fires were large enough that they could be seen from space. Although the dry season goes from July to October, and fires can be caused by nature in this period; many pointed out that the rate of deforestation in the past years was related to the increasing number of fires. The Brazilian Government was blamed for weakening the enforcement of environmental laws (LodoÂ¤o and Casado, 2019). The Federal Government of Brazil confronted these sayings as speculations and blamed different stakeholders, such as NGOs. While Brazilian NGOs expressed concern about a possible criminalization of their activities, the Brazilian Association of Non-Governmental Organizations expressed that this was a way of delegitimize civil society (Watts 2019). The Brazilian Government also accused international environmental organizations for paying people to set fires and take pictures to solicit donations from environmental activists and advocates (Reuters 2019). Using GIS software and publicly available data from different sources, a spatial analysis was conducted to understand if some type of correlation between deforestation and the fire locations in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest exists. </p>

            <a class="text-dark">Exploring the Relationship between Climate Change and Social Conflict</a>
          </h5>
          <p class="card-text">The growing literature on climate change and civil conflict suggests a potential correlation between deviations from normal climate occurrences and incidents of civil conflict.  While scholarly interest has burgeoned in this regard, there is little concrete evidence to suggest that climate change causes civil conflict.  This project seeks to expand on the existing body of work and broadens the scope of research along the lines of Cullen S. Hendrix and Idean Salehyan (2012) who utilize the Social Conflict Analysis Database (SCAD), that includes protests, riots, strikes, inter-communal conflict, government violence against civilians, and other forms of social conflict not systematically tracked in other conflict datasets.  Going further, this project utilizes both deviations from normal rainfall patterns as an indicator of drought and anomalies in climatology data that indicate extreme temperature deviations to posit a relationship between climate change and social conflict.  Despite findings of some correlations, the results of this project indicate that a causal link between deviations from regular climate occurrences and social conflict does not exist.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">A large portion of the New York State is covered by forests. Private entities own most of these lands (approximately 75% of total forests). Most of these private owners do not have any forest management plan for their lands, which can lead to unsustainable forest maintenance and loss of forestlands in the future. On the other side, high levels of suburban sprawl over the past few decades have had significant effects on forest loss all around the US. As cities stretch to low density undeveloped areas, forests and wild habitat are degraded in order to build new houses to accommodate new urban dwellers. In the United States, it has been estimated that urban land will grow by 5% from 2000 and reach 8.1% in 2050. This project explores the forest loss rate in the New York State to provide a better understanding of deforestation rates across NYS counties. The result of GIS analysis of Landsat imagery dataset provided by the University of Maryland shows that from the beginning of the new century NYS has lost almost 5 percent of its forestland. Most of the loss has happened in the north of the state in counties such as Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Saint Lawrence, and Saratoga. In almost all parts of the state, there is an increasing level of forestland loss over time. Interestingly, there is a high level of correlation between forest loss and years, accentuating forest loss has become a widespread threat and it will be getting worse in the future under a 'business-as- usual' scenario.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This project explores the density of health, education and sanitation services in informal settlements in Kampala, Uganda, at a time when the city is experiencing unprecedented growth. The growth and expansion are visible through the mushrooming of informal settlements across the city. Growing needs of existing communities combined with mixed migration flows are straining already overburdened public infrastructure and services. A key challenge for both the city and the communities has been lack of data on informal settlements, leading to a gap between the plans and the priorities for the slum residents. Using data from informal settlement profiling conducted by the local NGO Actogether Uganda, the paper develops a comparative analysis of service provision density in selected informal settlements. The result is a ranking of settlements based on the density of service/infrastructure type - healthcare, education, water and sanitation -, that highlights the unevenness of development and service provision across the selected informal settlements.  The ranking by service type highlights the key service gaps in each settlement and, combined with community-led prioritization of needs, can serve as a tool for targeted advocacy.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">In spite of an intensifying climate and natural disasters, such as hurricanes and flooding, more people are moving to New York City every year. This steady increasing population makes it very difficult to understand, manage and prevent air pollution trends affecting local residents. This GIS mapping project is intended to better analyze and understand two dimensions of community risk in relation to air pollution. These factors include exposure to hazards (pollution) and vulnerability (social factors). By combining these two dimensions of risk into one thematic map, a more comprehensive understanding of the distribution of risk throughout the city can be achieved. This risk analysis holds immense potential in representing and predicting air pollution trends in the city and which of these areas are most vulnerable to these hazards. This information can be used to inform local governments and communities on how to better support their residents both physically and socially. This project was intended to provide the firsts steps towards creating a more comprehensive understanding of localized pollution trends in New York City and how these trends overlap with various social vulnerabilities.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Internal armed conflict in Colombia left 8 million victims across a sixty year period. In 2016 a peace agreement was finally signed between the armed group FARC and Juan Manuel Santos government. Historically excluded regions in the rural areas of the country face more complex problems and difficulties relative to the post-peace agreement. Using GIS software and data from the Unidad de Victimas from the Government of Colombia, the purpose of this project is to show the number of victims by department from 1984 to 2019, categorized as urban and rural regions.</p>
